# Data Warehouse and Analytics Project with SQL Server

This project showcases the end-to-end development of a data warehousing and analytics solution aimed at consolidating and transforming data from multiple sources to deliver meaningful business insights. It serves as a demonstration of industry best practices in data engineering and business intelligence.

### Data Architecture:

The solution is built following the Medallion Architecture, structured into three progressive layers:

* **Bronze Layer**: Raw data ingestion layer where source data (CSV files) is loaded into SQL Server in its original form.
* **Silver Layer**: Data cleansing and normalization layer to enhance data quality and consistency.
* **Gold Layer**: Final business-ready layer, featuring data modeled in a star schema optimized for analytical queries and reporting.

### Project Highlights:

This project covers:

* Designing a modern multi-layered data warehouse architecture.
* Developing robust ETL pipelines to extract, transform, and load data across layers.
* Building fact and dimension tables optimized for analytics.
* Creating SQL-based reports and dashboards to generate actionable insights for decision makers.
